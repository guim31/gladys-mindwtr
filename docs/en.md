# Mindwtr

Your [Mindwtr](https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr) tasks (the free GTD
app) in Gladys: what waits in the inbox, your next actions, what is due today
or overdue. A scene reacts when a task reaches its due date or when the inbox
waits for its review, another one captures "buy bread" from a button or a
voice command, a tap on the dashboard marks a task done, and Gladys can read
today's tasks every morning.

> **Feedback welcome.** This integration was tested against a real Mindwtr
> sync server (Docker image `ghcr.io/dongdongbh/mindwtr-cloud` 1.3.6, October
> 2026), not yet in daily use. If something does not work as described, say
> so on the [Gladys forum](https://community.gladysassistant.com) or in the
> [issues](https://github.com/guim31/gladys-mindwtr/issues).

## What you need

- Gladys Assistant 5.1.0 or later.
- The **self-hosted sync server of Mindwtr**, `mindwtr-cloud` (see the
  [Mindwtr Docker guide](https://github.com/dongdongbh/Mindwtr/blob/main/docker/README.md)),
  reachable from Gladys. It listens on port **8787**.
- Your Mindwtr apps (desktop, phone, web app) synced with this server:
  **Settings** → **Sync** → **Self-Hosted**.

**Only the sync through this server works.** If your apps sync through
**Dropbox**, **WebDAV**, iCloud or a shared folder, the integration has
nothing to read: Mindwtr exposes its REST API on `mindwtr-cloud` only.
Moving to this server takes one Docker container and one token.

The integration reads and writes through the **REST API** of the server
(`/v1/tasks`), with the same token as the apps. It never touches the sync
document (`/v1/data`): the tasks added and completed go through the server,
which merges them as the apps do, and they appear on your devices at their
next sync.

## Installation

1. In Gladys, **Integrations** → install **Mindwtr**.
2. In the **Configuration** screen, fill in:
   - **Address**: the "Self-Hosted URL" of your apps, for example
     `http://192.168.1.20:8787`, or `https://mindwtr.example.org` behind Caddy
     or another reverse proxy (a prefix such as `/mindwtr` is kept; `/v1/data`
     at the end is dropped). It is the port of the server, **not** the one of
     the web app (5173);
   - **Sync token**: the token typed in your apps, one of the tokens of
     `MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKENS` on the server. Each token is its own task
     list: take the one of the list to follow.
3. Options:
   - **Inbox review after**: the delay of the **Mindwtr inbox to review**
     trigger (24 hours by default, from 4 hours to 1 week);
   - **Accept self-signed certificates**: for an `https://` address with a
     self-signed certificate (Caddy's local authority, for instance), on your
     own server only;
   - **Refresh interval**: 1 to 10 minutes (5 by default). Due times, the
     inbox review and midnight are always followed on time, whatever the
     interval;
   - **Language of the feature names**: the names given to the features when
     the device is added (French by default), and the texts sent to scenes.
4. Save, then **Test the connection**: the integration reads the server and
   gives the number of open tasks and of tasks in the inbox.
5. In the **Discovery** tab, add the **Mindwtr** device.

## Device

One **Mindwtr** device, with seven features:

| Feature              | What it shows                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tasks in the inbox` | the tasks captured and not clarified yet (Inbox list)                                                          |
| `Next actions`       | the tasks of the Next list                                                                                     |
| `Waiting for`        | the tasks of the Waiting list (what you expect from someone)                                                   |
| `Overdue tasks`      | the open tasks whose due time has passed                                                                       |
| `Tasks due today`    | the open tasks due today, whether their time has passed or not                                                 |
| `Tasks done today`   | the tasks marked done since midnight, in an app or from Gladys                                                 |
| `Next due date`      | the open task with the earliest due time still ahead, and when (`Take out the bins · 19:00`); `None` otherwise |

An **open** task is neither done, archived, deleted, nor a note of the
Reference list. A due date without a time is due until the end of that day,
as in the apps: the task is overdue from midnight on. "Today" and the times
are those of the time zone of Gladys: Mindwtr stores due dates without a time
zone, at the time you typed.

## Dashboard

The **Mindwtr: today** widget shows two tiles (due today, overdue), the list
of what is left for today, overdue first, with the time and the contexts of
each task, and a button for each of the four most urgent ones: a tap marks the
task done. When nothing is left, the widget says so and gives the next due
date.

The counters can also go on the dashboard like any device feature, and their
history is kept.

## Scenes

### Triggers

- **Mindwtr task due**: an open task reaches its due time; for a due date
  without a time, at the start of that day (midnight). The `all_day` value
  tells which.
- **Mindwtr task overdue**: at midnight, a task due that day is still not
  done. Once per task and due date.
- **Mindwtr inbox to review**: an item has waited in the inbox for the delay
  of the configuration (24 hours by default). The trigger comes back at the
  same interval until the inbox has been emptied: the reminder of the GTD
  review. Values: the number of tasks in the inbox, the oldest one, its age in
  hours.
- **Mindwtr task added**: a new task appears, captured on a phone, through the
  API or from Gladys (`from_gladys` is then true, so that a scene does not
  start itself again). The next occurrence of a repeating task does not count.

Filters: the GTD list (inbox, next actions, waiting for, someday/maybe) for
the three task triggers, and the exact title for the first two. Values passed
to the actions: the task, its id, its list, its contexts, its project, its due
date as in Mindwtr (`2026-10-21T19:00`) and `all_day`.

A task done before its due date fires nothing. Nor does a due date moved into
the past by hand: only the moments that pass while the integration runs count.
A restart fires nothing twice; a moment that passed while the integration was
stopped fires at its restart, if it is less than an hour old.

### Actions

- **Add a task to the Mindwtr inbox**: a title, and if you want a due date and
  contexts. The due date is written `2026-10-25`, `25/10`, `tomorrow`,
  `today`, optionally followed by a time (`tomorrow 18:30`, `25/10 9:00`); a
  due date not understood makes the action fail rather than store a wrong
  date. Contexts are written `@home` or `home`, several separated by blanks or
  commas. The title is kept as is: a `#` or an `@` in the title is not parsed.
  Results: the task, its id, its due date.
- **Mark a Mindwtr task done**: the exact **title** of an open task (case and
  accents ignored), or its id (`{{triggerEvent.data.task_id}}` of a trigger).
  A repeating task moves on to its next occurrence, as in the apps. Results:
  the task, its id.
- **Read today's Mindwtr tasks**: as a sentence
  (`4 task(s) for today: …. 2 overdue. 2 in the inbox.`), for every context or
  one (`@home`). Results: the sentence, the number of tasks for today (overdue
  included), of overdue tasks, of tasks in the inbox. Send the sentence in a
  message, or have Gladys say it.

The text fields accept scene variables.

### Scene ideas

- At 7:30, **Read today's Mindwtr tasks**, then send the sentence on Telegram
  or have the kitchen speaker say it.
- A button by the door runs **Add a task to the Mindwtr inbox** with
  `Buy bread` and the context `@errands`.
- **Mindwtr inbox to review** on Sunday evening: a message "5 items wait in
  your inbox, the oldest for 72 hours".
- **Mindwtr task due** with the title `Take out the bins`: blink the light of
  the hall; an NFC tag on the bin runs **Mark a Mindwtr task done**.

## Troubleshooting

- **"The sync server does not answer"**: check the address and the port from
  the machine of Gladys (`http://<address>:8787/health` answers
  `{"ok":true}`).
- **"Token refused"**: the token is not in `MINDWTR_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKENS` of the
  server (badly copied, or removed). Copy the one of the sync settings of the
  app.
- **"No Mindwtr sync server at this address"**: the address answers, but not
  with the API: often the port of the web app (5173) instead of the server's
  (8787), or a proxy asking for a login (Authelia) in front of `/v1`.
- **"The address redirects"**: enter the `https://` address.
- **"The server cannot use its data folder"**: a problem of the server itself
  (permissions of the `/app/cloud_data` volume); its logs explain it.
- **The counters are at zero**: the token is accepted, but it is the one of
  another list (one token = one list). Check it is the same as in the apps.
- **"Several open tasks have this title"**: rename one of them, or use the id
  given by a trigger.
- Logs: `LOG_LEVEL=debug` on the container shows every reading.

## Limits

- Only through the self-hosted sync server `mindwtr-cloud`: neither Dropbox,
  nor WebDAV, nor iCloud, nor a local file.
- The server is read every 1 to 10 minutes (and at each due time, at the inbox
  review and at midnight): a task done on the phone appears in Gladys within
  that delay, once the phone has synced. Three requests per reading (open
  tasks, done tasks, projects), plus one per page of 500 tasks; the server
  accepts 120 a minute by default.
- The integration adds tasks to the inbox and marks tasks done; it does not
  edit, delete or move them.
- Tasks of the Reference list are not counted. Areas are not used.
- Tested with `mindwtr-cloud` 1.3.6.
- Gladys keeps no Mindwtr data but `/data/mindwtr-state.json`: the time of the
  last reading, the ids of the open tasks and the time of the last review, so
  that no event fires twice. The token is not in it.
- Not affiliated with the Mindwtr project.
